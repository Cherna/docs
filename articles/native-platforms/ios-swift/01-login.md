## Configure Callback URLs

Callback URLs are the URLs that Auth0 invokes after the authentication process. Auth0 routes your application back to this URL and appends additional parameters to it, including a token. Since callback URLs can be manipulated, you will need to add your application's URL to your client's *Allowed Callback URLs* for security. This will enable Auth0 to recognize these URLs as valid. If omitted, authentication will not be successful.

In your application's `Info.plist` file, register your iOS Bundle Identifer as a custom scheme:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>None</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>auth0</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

Finally, go to your [Client's Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings) and make sure that *Allowed Callback URLs* contains the following:

`{YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER}://{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/ios/{YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER}/callback`
